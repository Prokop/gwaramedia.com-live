Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: version: *0.3.0*
We could get the version, so yes, a plain cwebp call works
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 2 binaries: 
- /bin/cwebp
- /usr/bin/cwebp
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 1 binaries:

Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Linux)... We do. We in fact have 3

Quality of source is 82. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
*The near-lossless option is not supported on this (rather old) version of cwebp- skipping it.*
